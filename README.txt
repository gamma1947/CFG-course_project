This project is to find binding sites for Transcription factors on the DNA molecule robustly in in vivo settings. 

Goals:
	- To convert .tsv files to .bed files and then extract the fasta files using bedtools
		- (hck) I have pushed the necessary codes to do the same in the repository. Please change the name of directories appropriately and use them
